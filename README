A first person shooter built on SDL2--from scratch

I will start by creating an overview of how the project works
Using pseudocode. Then I will add in SDL2 or similar.
Then I will translate the pseudo into a semi workable Graphic program.
Finally I will add physics and geometry

(This is a test btw.)
